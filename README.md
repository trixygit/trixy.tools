**Main Website:** https://trixy.tools

This repository contains the **TRIXY Tools** main website – a central hub aggregating all TRIXY utilities (developer tools, SEO helpers, automation modules, dashboards, and more). It provides unified navigation to sub-services such as TrustPositif Checker, Notepad, CodeHost, ImageHost, FileHost, and other TRIXY-branded tools.

**Deployment Notes**

- The main application is served from the `public_html/` directory.
- Ensure your hosting (e.g., cPanel) points the document root accordingly.
- Environment-specific configuration (if any) should be stored in `.env` or the platform’s config panel.
- For asset paths and rewrites, review `.htaccess`/web server rules under the web root.
